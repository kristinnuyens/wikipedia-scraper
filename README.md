# Wikipedia Scraper

## 🏢 Description

In this project, we created a scraper that built a JSON file with the political leaders of each country from [this API](https://country-leaders.onrender.com/docs).

Within this file, we included the first paragraph of the Wikipedia page of these leaders.

## 🧩 Installation

## 🛎️ Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

2. Run the script, by executing `leaders_scraper.py` in the Terminal command line:

```
python3 src/leaders_scraper.py

In case you notice this script runs into problems, you can try out the `leaders_scraper_EXCEPTIONS.py` instead, as it will give you some guidance on what may be going wrong during execution.
